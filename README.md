# 2048
2048 game that utilizes python and tkinter
This is a rendition of my original in-class project where we had to create the game, 2048, utilizing matrixs.
As fun as that was, I was disliked how the game would be played in the shell, so I decided to utilize 
tkinter, a GUI, to recreate the actual game graphics. Later, I will be adding an option for the user/player to have the ability
to let the game play itself. Through working on this project, I was able to familiarize myself with the GUI and I learned 
about classes in python.
